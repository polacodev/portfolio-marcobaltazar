  About me
</h2>
<p class="text-pretty ml-2 opacity-80">
  I have a degree in Systems Engineering and bring more than four years of
  experience in commercial software development. Proficient in JavaScript,
  TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Node.js and C#. I specialize in frontend, but I
  can work as backend and mobile developer with React Native. My commitment to
  quality spans the development lifecycle, from design to maintenance. Eager to
  learn new technologies, I thrive in dynamic environments. Ready to contribute
  expertise to impactful projects.
